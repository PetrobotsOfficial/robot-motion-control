# Accurate Robot Motion Control without External Reference System 

This is UTP Petrobot's first major step into autonomous mobile robotics. For V1.0, we focus our efforts into developing autonomous
control algorithm and system to control a robotâ€™s movement without external reference (e.g. wall, line, etc.) in 2D space. 
Our control parameters include the robot's:
* DIRECTION
* TRAVEL DISTANCE
* COORDINATE IN SPACE
Note that this robot is not capable of sensing and responding to external stimuli. It is able to move in two ways: going straight for a
specified distance and turning on spot for a specified angle. All movements are pre-programmed parameters.
